## Contribution Guidelines and Standards
Before sending your pull request for review, make sure your changes are consistent with the 
guidelines and follow the coding style.

## General Guidelines and Philosophy for Contribution
Include unit tests when you contribute new features, as they help to prove that your code works 
correctly, and guard against future breaking changes to lower the maintenance cost.

Bug fixes also generally require unit tests, because the presence of bugs usually indicates 
insufficient test coverage.

Keep API compatibility in mind when you change code in core TrustNote.

## License
